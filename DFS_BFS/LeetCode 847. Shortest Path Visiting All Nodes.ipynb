    "### 847. Shortest Path Visiting All Nodes\n",
    "You have an undirected, connected graph of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are given an array graph where graph[i] is a list of all the nodes connected with node i by an edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the length of the shortest path that visits every node. You may start and stop at any node, you may revisit nodes multiple times, and you may reuse edges.\n",

    "#### Example 1:\n",
    "<img src='https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/12/shortest1-graph.jpg' width=128><br>\n",
    "- Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[0],[0],[0]]\n",
    "- Output: 4\n",
    "- Explanation: One possible path is [1,0,2,0,3]\n",

    "- n == graph.length\n",
    "- 1 <= n <= 12\n",
    "- 0 <= graph[i].length < n\n",
    "- graph[i] does not contain i.\n",
